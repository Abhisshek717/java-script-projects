HTML structure:

1. Create a container element:
    - Create a **`<div>`** element with a unique ID to serve as the container for the light circles.
2. Create seven **`<div>`** elements for the circles:
    - Create seven **`<div>`** elements inside the container element.
    - Assign unique IDs to each **`<div>`** element to identify them later.

Circle styling:

1. CSS styling:
    - Use CSS to style the circles with appropriate colors, sizes, and spacing.
    - Apply a class or ID selector to target the circle elements.
2. Add transition effects:
    - Use CSS transitions to create a smooth intensity change effect.
    - Define the transition property and duration for the circle elements.

Timer-based intensity change:

1. JavaScript timer functionality:
    - Write JavaScript code to handle the timer functionality.
    - Use either **`setInterval`** or **`setTimeout`** functions to trigger the intensity change at regular intervals.
2. Intensity change logic:
    - Implement code to change the intensity of the circles when the timer triggers.
    - Ensure that when a circle is brightened, the intensity of its predecessor returns to normal.

Button functionality:

1. Create a button element:
    - Add a **`<button>`** element to the HTML structure.
2. Button click event handling:
    - Write JavaScript code to handle the button click event.
    - Implement logic to start and stop the display when the button is clicked.

Interval change:

1. Create an input field:
    - Add an **`<input>`** element of type "number" to allow users to specify the interval time for intensity change.
2. Input change event handling:
    - Write JavaScript code to handle the input change event.
    - Capture the user's input and update the interval time for intensity change accordingly.

These tasks provide a breakdown of the main functionalities required for the Christmas Lights application. You can work on each task separately to implement them in your chosen programming environment.
